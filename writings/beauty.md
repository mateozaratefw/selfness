# What's beauty

Beauty is something that's being true to itself. Something that excellently serves the purpose it was intended for. It's not subjective, one chooses what's it's own **code** is and judges by that. This is mine.

One heuristic to understand my code it's that it finds allure in things that **transmit what they were intended to in the cleanest of channels**. 

Personally, I've found beauty in disturbing, off-putting pieces. Pablo Picasso's ![Le Moulin de la Galette](/images/le-moulin-de-la-galette.jpg) makes me feel seen. **Makes me feel an outsider**. And that feeling is what it was intended to communicate. It was painted on it's first years in Paris and it represents one of his **first encounters** with high society, when he was not yet Pablo Picasso. 

Another example is brutalism. The best brutalism makes you feel horror and desolation. ![Berlin's brutalist mouse bunker](/images/Zentrale-Tierlaboratorien-Maeusebunker-Gerd-Haenska.jpg) it's an architectural masterpiece because how would you expect an animal testing facility to look like? It would be a horrible building if it were rennaicense.

Obviously we can also find beauty in playful, joyful things. I believe nothing comes closer to representing that in the tech realm than the ![Apple iMac G3](/images/iMac-G3_blue.jpeg). It's see-trough -- it has nothing to hide, it has a handle so you can move it around as you want and it's colorful! it charms you just to see it, and anyone from a child to an old IBM manager would be happy to have one on it's desk. 

I've arrived to this definition of beauty after asking myself why I liked the ![Buenos Aires IBM building](/images/ibm-building-buenos-aires.webp) so much. It's just a boring, office building and there is nothing more IBM than that. It even looks like a boring computer. 

I grew up thinking I should love the rennaissence columns and ornaments in a 2010-built home in my cheap neighborhood and I just couldn't find emotion in myself when looking at it. Now I realize that's because **it's fake**.

## Some stuff I find beautiful: 

![Fansworth House](/images/FarnsworthHouse-Mies-5.jpg). Peak minimalism while stating it's position in nature. It's a minumum intervention of men in nature. Useful, simple. 

![Alexander McQueen scarf](/images/alexander-mcqueen-scarf_blue.jpg). It's odd, slightly cringy and has the minimum amount of darkness. It's so McQueen it hurts. 

![Concorde](/images/concorde.jpg). Commercial speed at it's peak. It's the fastest way of moving for people and it feels like it. It's design it's derived out from the engineering excelence it took to be made. 

![SR-71 Blackbird](/images/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird.jpg). It looks like it's going to fucking kill you. Absolutely timeless and weird. 

▶[Supersonic|Definitely Maybe|/covers/definitely-maybe.jpg](/music/06%20-%20Supersonic%20(Remastered).mp3). It's a really simple song with simple lyrics and simple sounds yet it makes you fell completely supersonic. You suddenly became invencible for 3 minutes.
