My interpretation of beauty is something that's being true to itself. Something that excellently serves the purpose it was intended for. 

This can be found in a painting, where you clearly feel what the artist was trying to tell. 
Or in products, where it's serving it's transmitted in the cleanest of channels.

This is why I believe that to truly enjoy something, one must know it's creator. 
I admire a creator based upon it's works, which are dictated by it's life; therefore, I admire the creator itself and it's experiences.

Personally, I've found beauty in disturbing, off-putting pieces. Pablo Picasso's ![Le Moulin de la Galette](/images/le-moulin-de-la-galette.jpg) makes me feel seen. Makes me feel an outsider. I like that. I came to this interpretation after understanding what was Picasso on when he was painting this. It was painted on it's first years in Paris. It's first encounter with society! It makes you feel what it was intended to; thus it's beautiful.

I've come to grasp some sort of intuition on what's beautiful, so I can enjoy things without knowing it's creator. For example, I don't really know the history behind ![Hunters in the Snow](/images/hunters-in-the-snow.gif), but it's beautiful and i feel profoundly interpelled by it,

On my personal work, I surely must not try and seek to make the user feel this way. I believe strangeness is not to be *generated*. **My work is true to itself** and if it's strange, let there be it.

Some stuff I find beautiful: 

![Alexander McQueen scarf](/images/alexander-mcqueen-scarf_blue.webp). It's odd, slightly cringy and has the minimum amount of darkness. It's so McQueen it hurts.
