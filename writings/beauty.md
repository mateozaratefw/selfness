# What beauty is

I came across the ![Buenos Aires IBM building](/images/ibm-building-buenos-aires.webp) and couldn't understand why I've found it so beautiful. Its a boring, grey building but I couldn't stop looking at it. I've started asking myself which things I find beautiful and I arrived some conclusions. I'll ignore traditional beauty as the biggest expression of it is found in **non obvious** items.

To explain it, I discard the subjetiveness as it makes it impossible to study beauty; if you don't believe that beauty is objective, you can't seem to develop a taste. 

**Beauty is something that's being true to itself. Something that excellently serves the purpose it was intended for**. Things that transmit what they were intended to in the cleanest of channels. Please, don't confuse this with minimalism; this ignores complex systems that are one of the most beautiful things humanity has produced. 

Let me give you some examples. 

What's great about the ![IBM building](/images/ibm-building-buenos-aires.webp)? It represents IBM at its fullest; it's a tall, grey, boring, office building. What's more IBM than that? It wouldn't be beautiful if it say "Apple" at the top.

More architecture; brutalism. The best brutalism makes you feel horror and desolation. ![Berlin's brutalist mouse bunker](/images/brutalism) it's an architectural masterpiece because how would you expect an animal testing facility to look like? It would be a horrible building if it were minimalist. I don't think the ![trendy eco-brutalism](/images/concrete-jungle.jpg) it's beautiful. When architecture tries to blend with nature it must do so following the nature lines (check ![organic architecture](/images/casa-organica.webp)). If you want to disrupt nature, build a monolith. Eco-brutalism stays at a bland medium.

Obviously we can also find beauty in playful, joyful things. I believe nothing comes closer to representing that in the tech realm than the ![Apple iMac G3](/images/imac-g3). It's see-trough -- it has nothing to hide, it has a handle so you can move it around as you want (full power, it invites to play) and its colorful! It charms you just to see it, and anyone from a child to an old designer would be happy to have one on their desk. 

On art; Pablo Picasso's ![Le Moulin de la Galette](/images/le-moulin-de-la-galette.jpg). Makes me feel seen. **Makes me feel an outsider**. Not casually, It was painted in his first years in Paris and it represents one of his **first encounters** with high society, when he was not yet Pablo Picasso. When Picasso was an outsider.

A systems example would be the now classic ![SpaceX Raptor evolution](/images/raptor-3-evolution.jpg). The iteration cleaned up the engine, but it's still a crazy complex system; just cleaner (and thus, prettier).

But beauty does not ends in things; if not, how could we explain [SpaceX's fourth Falcon 1 launch](/falcon-1)? The human doing what's here for; **to mold nature as we want**. That's what the 4th launch (epically) represents.

Why does it seems to get amplified when found in a non-obvious place? 

When people try hard to make something beautiful, they sometimes found themselves following *beauty guidelines* instead of concentrating in answering on the cleanest way possible the question of nature; **what's this for?** 

## Some stuff I find beautiful: 

![Fansworth House](/images/FarnsworthHouse-Mies-5.jpg). Peak minimalism while stating its position in nature. It's a minumum intervention of men in nature. Useful, simple. 

![Alexander McQueen scarf](/images/alexander-mcqueen-scarf_blue.jpg). It's odd, slightly cringy and has the minimum amount of darkness. It's so McQueen it hurts. 

![Concorde](/images/concorde.jpg). Commercial speed at its peak. It's the fastest way of moving for people and it feels like it. Its design is derived out from the engineering excelence it took to be made. 

![SR-71 Blackbird](/images/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird.jpg). It looks like it's going to fucking kill you. Absolutely timeless and weird. 

▶[Supersonic|Definitely Maybe|/covers/definitely-maybe.jpg](/music/06%20-%20Supersonic%20(Remastered).mp3). It's a really simple song with simple lyrics and simple sounds yet makes you feel completely supersonic. You suddenly became invincible for 3 minutes.
