# What's beauty

Beauty is something that's being true to itself. Something that excellently serves the purpose it was intended for. It's not subjective, one chooses what its own **code** is and judges by that. This is mine.

One heuristic to understand my code is that it finds allure in things that **transmit what they were intended to in the cleanest of channels**. 

Personally, I've found beauty in disturbing, off-putting pieces. Pablo Picasso's ![Le Moulin de la Galette](/images/le-moulin-de-la-galette.jpg) makes me feel seen. **Makes me feel an outsider**. And that feeling is what it was intended to communicate. It was painted in his first years in Paris and it represents one of his **first encounters** with high society, when he was not yet Pablo Picasso. 

Another example is brutalism. The best brutalism makes you feel horror and desolation. ![Berlin's brutalist mouse bunker](/images/brutalism) it's an architectural masterpiece because how would you expect an animal testing facility to look like? It would be a horrible building if it were renaissance.

Obviously we can also find beauty in playful, joyful things. I believe nothing comes closer to representing that in the tech realm than the ![Apple iMac G3](/images/imac-g3). It's see-trough -- it has nothing to hide, it has a handle so you can move it around as you want and its colorful! it charms you just to see it, and anyone from a child to an old IBM manager would be happy to have one on their desk. 

I've arrived to this definition after asking myself why I liked the ![Buenos Aires IBM building](/images/ibm-building-buenos-aires.webp) so much. It's just a boring, office building and there is nothing more IBM than that. It even looks like a boring computer. **It's absolutely true to itself.**

When building something—whether coding or designing—I always ask myself: what's this for? I firmly believe that beautiful things exist for a reason. No one creates incredible things accidentally. 

## Some stuff I find beautiful: 

![Fansworth House](/images/FarnsworthHouse-Mies-5.jpg). Peak minimalism while stating its position in nature. It's a minumum intervention of men in nature. Useful, simple. 

![Alexander McQueen scarf](/images/alexander-mcqueen-scarf_blue.jpg). It's odd, slightly cringy and has the minimum amount of darkness. It's so McQueen it hurts. 

![Concorde](/images/concorde.jpg). Commercial speed at its peak. It's the fastest way of moving for people and it feels like it. Its design is derived out from the engineering excelence it took to be made. 

![SR-71 Blackbird](/images/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird.jpg). It looks like it's going to fucking kill you. Absolutely timeless and weird. 

▶[Supersonic|Definitely Maybe|/covers/definitely-maybe.jpg](/music/06%20-%20Supersonic%20(Remastered).mp3). It's a really simple song with simple lyrics and simple sounds yet it makes you feel completely supersonic. You suddenly became invincible for 3 minutes.
