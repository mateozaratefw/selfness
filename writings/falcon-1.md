# SpaceX's fourth Falcon 1 launch

After three consecutive failures between 2006 and 2008, SpaceX was nearly broke. Elon Musk had poured most of his PayPal fortune into the company, and morale was devastated after the third failure in August 2008 — a launch that failed due to residual thrust causing the first and second stages to collide during separation.

SpaceX had enough parts for one more attempt. The team worked around the clock on Omelek Island in the Kwajalein Atoll, and on September 28, 2008, Falcon 1 finally reached orbit — becoming the first privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to do so.
